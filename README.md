# City Police Department Data Directory 
The Vera Institute of Justice has compiled a spreadsheet containing links to official police datasets for 72 cities - the 50 largest cities in the country and the largest city in each state. City size was determined using National Census data from 2010 through 2019. 

## Data 
The data file is available in [CSV format](PD_Data_Directory.csv) and as a [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-B2HYafrtAJITeBxsv_ZHACH79edyw3IstdczCyhemU/edit?usp=sharing). Each row corresponds to a city and provides links to data specifically made available by that city's police department. Some city police departments share a jurisdiction with other law enforcement agencies—such as sheriff’s departments and university police departments—which are not accounted for in this resource. Therefore, policing data provided by the police department of a particular city may not capture the operations of all policing organizations in that locality. 

Links to four different types of data sources are provided (where found). Those four types of data and the variables pertaining to each are as follows: 

### Use of Force 

The variables related to Use of Force are 
*`uof_url`: link to report or raw data reporting instances in which force is used by police officers 
*`shootings`: indicates those datasets which only report officer-involved shootings  
*`uof_coverage`: span of time covered by dataset 
*`foia_requested` indicates whether a FOIA request was made for the data on behalf of the [Use of Force Project](http://useofforceproject.org/). 
*`uof_notes`: other relevant information about the dataset or availability of information through the police department. For example, other distinctions in qualifications for inclusion in the dataset. 

### Arrests 

The variables related to Arrests are 
*`arr_url`: link to reports or raw data reporting arrests made by city police officers 
*`arr_coverage`: span of time covered by dataset 
*`arr_demographic`: indicates whether the dataset includes demographic data for each arrest 
*`arr_download`: indicates whether the data itself is able to be exported from the online interface 
*`arr_notes`: other relevant information about the dataset or availability of information through the police department 

### Crime 

The variables related to Crime are 
*`crime_url`: link to reports or raw data reporting crime incidents 
*`crime_coverage`: span of time covered by dataset 
*`crime_download`: indicates whether the data itself is able to be exported from the online interface 
*`crime_notes`: other relevant information about the dataset or availability of information through the police department 
*`map_url`: link to geographic visualization reporting crime incidents 
*`map_coverage`: span of time covered by dataset 
*`map_download`: indicates whether the data itself is able to be exported from the online interface 
*`map_notes`: other relevant information about the dataset or availability of information through the police department 

### Calls for Service 

Note: Since not all calls for service are indicative of crime and not all crimes are reported via 911, these data sources are distinct from crime (incident) data sources. 

The variables related to Calls for Service are 
*`cfs_url`: link to reports or raw data reporting calls for service 
*`cfs_coverage`: span of time covered by dataset 
*`cfs_download`: indicates whether the data itself is able to be exported from the online interface 
*`officer_initiated`: indicates whether the dataset captures interactions initiated by officers (such as traffic stops, street investigations, observing crimes in progress, etc)
*`dispatched`: indicates whether the dataset includes only cases in which an officer was dispatched 
*`cfs_outcome`: indicates whether the dataset includes the outcome of each call for service 
*`cfs_location`: indicates whether the dataset includes location data for each call for service 
*`cfs_notes`: other relevant information about the dataset or availability of information through the police department 

## A Collaborative Resource 

Vera welcomes help filling gaps in the spreadsheet. To search for missing data, use a search engine or visit your local open-data portal or police department website to review available data. Use search terms such as “arrest data,” “911 calls for service data,” “crime incident data,” and “use of force data.” If you find official datasets to add to Vera’s spreadsheet, please email their locations to ArrestTrends@vera.org. 

Vera recognizes that national policing data provided by other online sources may provide meaningful context to the exploration of the city policing data provided in this spreadsheet. Therefore, Vera has assembled a small list of national policing data sources - find those links [here](Contextual_Datasources.csv). Vera welcomes additions to this list. If you find another public data source to add to this list, please email ArrestTrends@vera.org.  

These resources will be updated regularly to reflect the most recent contributions.
